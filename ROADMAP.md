# SEAM Improvement Roadmap & SOP Blueprint

**Last updated:** 2026-05-08
**Status:** Active planning document. This is the living roadmap for SEAM development beyond the stable v1 core.

## 2026-05-01 Functional Visual Memory Target

The next roadmap target is making the full SEAM visual-memory loop functional:

```
documents -> directly readable machine language -> SEAM-HS/1 image surfaces -> stored surface library -> direct image-surface query/context
```

This target is not just "save a screenshot." The image is the storage envelope
for SEAM machine language. The useful data inside the image must stay readable
by SEAM without restoring the original document, running OCR on the rendered
image, or importing the payload into SQLite first.

Required behavior:

- Document compression emits directly readable MIRL or `SEAM-RC/1` records with
  quote spans, headings, table cells, entities, claims, references, source
  hashes, and provenance.
- Surface packing stores that machine-language payload in a lossless
  `SEAM-HS/1` PNG using `rgb24` by default or explicit `rgba32` / `rgba64`
  for higher channel density.
- Surface storage keeps the generated `.seam.png` artifacts addressable as a
  surface library, with SQLite metadata for artifact path, payload format,
  PNG mode, source hash, payload hash, verification status, and import/query
  status.
- Direct read must decode the PNG pixel payload in memory, verify the payload
  hash, and answer query/search/context requests from the embedded MIRL or
  `SEAM-RC/1` records without rebuilding the original document.
- SQLite remains canonical for active imported memory. Stored surfaces are
  portable, immutable, directly readable artifacts; PACK remains derived
  prompt-time context, not the owner of raw image bytes.
- Benchmark proof must cover document-to-machine-language exactness,
  machine-language-to-surface hash preservation, stored-surface lookup, and
  direct query exactness, including stored query after original-output deletion
  and repaired redundant-copy query.

SOP:

1. Build a document compiler path that converts source documents into
   directly readable MIRL/RC records before any surface packing.
2. Add a surface library/store command that writes `.seam.png` files under a
   controlled artifact directory and records metadata in SQLite.
   - 2026-05-07 status: landed on `main`. `surface store|list|show|repair`,
     `compile --store`, `encode --store`, stable `hs:<hash>` IDs, redundant
     file-backed copies, and stored-ID verify/query/search/context/decode/import
     are available from the source-of-truth branch.
3. Add surface lookup commands for list, verify, query, search, context, import,
   and repair/rebuild-from-source when source material is still available.
4. Keep raw original documents optional and operator-controlled. They are
   useful for audits and rebuilds, but they must not be required for direct
   query once a verified MIRL/RC surface exists.
5. Add benchmark fixtures that prove exact answers can be read from the stored
   image surface itself.
   - 2026-05-07 status: landed on `main`. The release-blocking surface family
     includes stored lookup, stored query after original-output deletion,
     redundant-copy repair, and repaired-copy query rates at 100%.

Next resume target:

- Continue with the document compiler path for directly readable MIRL/RC records
  from richer source documents, then keep proving that direct query/context can
  read from stored HS/1 image surfaces without requiring the original document.
- Start the Agent Compiler workstream in `docs/roadmap/AGENT_COMPILER.md` when
  working on Claude/Codex/Gemini/Cursor/Aider operating skills. The goal is not
  one-off prompt patches; it is generated, benchmarked, auditable agent adapters
  from canonical SEAM protocol.

## 2026-04-30 Holographic Surface Integration

Holographic Surface is now a roadmap track for directly readable visual memory
snapshots:

- `SEAM-HS/1` is a lossless PNG-backed surface that stores MIRL, `SEAM-RC/1`,
  `SEAM-LX/1`, or raw bytes in pixel data.
- The surface stores machine language, not pictures of text. Direct read means
  SEAM reads pixel bytes into the embedded MIRL/RC payload in memory, then runs
  the normal parser, query, search, or context path.
- No OCR, natural-language recompilation, or SQLite import is required for
  direct surface query/context workflows.
- v1 supports `bw1` proof mode, `rgb24`/`rgb` default density mode, explicit
  `rgba32` high-density mode, and explicit 16-bit `rgba64`. JPEG and other
  lossy formats are rejected for exact memory.
- The automatic operator flow is `seam surface compile <source> --output
  <file.seam.png>`: compile source text into MIRL, then encode the MIRL bytes
  into a PNG surface using `rgb24` unless a denser mode is requested.
- The benchmark gate is `surface_exact_rate == 1.0`,
  `payload_hash_match_rate == 1.0`, direct query exactness, stored lookup,
  stored query after original-output deletion, repair success, and repaired-copy
  query exactness all at 100%.
- The claim is higher effective intelligence density for already-compiled SEAM
  machine language, not impossible free compression.

SOP:

1. Use `seam surface compile <source> --output <file.seam.png> --mode rgb24`
   for source text that should become MIRL-backed surface memory.
2. Encode existing RC/1 or MIRL with `seam surface encode <input> --output <file.seam.png> --mode rgb24`.
3. Use `--mode rgba32` only for explicit higher channel density; it stores 4
   bytes per pixel but alpha channels are easier for image tooling to mutate.
4. Use `--mode rgba64` only when 16-bit RGBA density is required; it stores 8
   bytes per pixel and should be verified after any image-tooling touch.
5. Verify with `seam surface verify <file.seam.png>`.
6. Query without import using `seam surface query`, `seam surface search`, or
   `seam surface context`.
7. Import only when the snapshot should become active SQLite memory.
8. Gate changes with `seam benchmark run surface`.

## 2026-04-28 Competitive Integration Update

The current competitive plan moves README/install/RAG work ahead of older
presentation polish:

- Product-first README and private-repo one-line install commands are now part
  of the active install track.
- RAG modes are `vector`, `graph`, `hybrid`, and `mix`, with `mix` intended as
  the agent default after benchmark validation.
- Progressive disclosure is a first-class agent memory pattern:
  `seam memory search` for compact results, then `seam memory get` for selected
  full records.
- Agent ecosystem compatibility should use thin CLI/REST/stdio wrappers over
  the Python runtime, not a runtime rewrite.
- LightRAG-style document status, graph expansion, vector cache/stale metadata,
  and future reranking belong in the RAG/scalability track.

## Track A0 — True Interactive TUI (foundation for all UI work)

### A0: Migrate Dashboard to Textual — Live Panels, In-Place Input, Scrollable Boxes

**What:** Replace the current Rich-based re-render loop with a proper interactive TUI using **Textual**. The dashboard becomes a persistent session: input is handled at the bottom of the screen in-place, panels update reactively without flashing or reprinting, and every data panel is independently scrollable within its bordered box. A `seam-dash` CLI entrypoint launches it directly.

**Why first:** Every other Track A item (animations, graphs, chat tab, presentation mode) is easier and cleaner to build on a proper TUI framework than on top of a re-render loop. This is the foundation.

**How:**
- Migrate from `Rich.Live` full-screen re-render → **Textual** widgets with reactive data bindings
- Each panel becomes a Textual `DataTable`, `ListView`, or custom `ScrollView` widget — independently scrollable
- Input bar at the bottom is a Textual `Input` widget; on submit it runs the existing `execute()` logic and updates only the affected panel
- Add `seam-dash = "seam_runtime.dashboard:main"` to `[project.scripts]` in `pyproject.toml`
- Keep `seam dashboard` as an alias; keep `--snapshot` (headless) mode working throughout

**Panels that get independent scroll:**
- Memory Records
- Search / Retrieval Results
- Benchmark Results
- Runtime Log / Event stream
- Chat (when Track A5 lands)

**SOP:**
1. Add `textual>=0.50` as optional extra (`seam-runtime[dash]`) or promote to base if dashboard is a primary interface
2. Port existing panels to Textual widgets one at a time — keep snapshot fallback working at every step
3. Wire `Input` widget at bottom; results update the relevant panel reactively
4. Add `seam-dash` console entrypoint to `pyproject.toml`
5. Test: `--snapshot` headless export must still pass; add ≥3 Textual widget tests
6. Gate: no full-screen flash on any input; all panels scroll independently; works on Windows terminal and Linux/WSL2

---

## Track A — Dashboard & UI Enhancement
History pointer: see `HISTORY#047` (interactive TUI baseline) and `HISTORY#024` (dashboard review stabilization).

### A-Web: IDE-Like Browser Dashboard / REST API GUI

**What:** Make the browser dashboard feel like an IDE/operator workspace, using
the prototype in `experimental/webui/` as the visual target. The shell should
keep an activity bar, explorer/files view, tabbed main editor/workspace, agent
pane, terminal/command surface, memory view, ingest view, benchmark view,
settings, and status bar.

**Role:** This is the future REST API GUI, not a replacement for the stable
Textual terminal dashboard yet. Textual remains the terminal-first dashboard;
the web dashboard becomes the richer browser surface served by or alongside
`seam serve`.

**Current prototype:** `experimental/webui/seam-dashboard-prototype.html`
contains the IDE-like SEAM dashboard mockup and supporting assets. It currently
uses demo state and must be wired to real SEAM endpoints before runtime
promotion.

**SOP:**
1. Keep the prototype under `experimental/webui/` until it has real API wiring,
   local build/test commands, and no CDN/Babel runtime dependency.
2. Split the single-file prototype into a maintainable app shell, API client,
   state stores, panes, and shared visual tokens.
3. Wire first to existing REST endpoints: `/health`, `/stats`, `/compile`,
   `/search`, `/context`, `/persist`, and `/lossless-compress`.
4. Add backend endpoints only when the GUI needs behavior that the REST API
   cannot currently provide: ingest file, benchmark run/gate, surface
   list/show/query/repair, event logs, and model/chat routing.
5. Keep secrets local. API keys and bearer tokens must be entered through local
   environment/config surfaces and must not be committed.
6. Package only after verification proves browser UI state matches real SEAM
   runtime state.

**Gate:** `seam serve` or a dedicated `seam web` command can open the IDE-like
dashboard, connect to a local SEAM API, show real health/stats/search/context
data, run at least one compile-or-search workflow, and pass browser smoke tests
without breaking `seam dashboard`.

### A-CLI: First-Class Agent CLI

**What:** Turn `seam` into a CLI product in the same family as Gemini CLI,
Claude Code, and Codex CLI: an interactive shell that can remember, retrieve,
reason over local SEAM memory, call SEAM tools, and eventually route model
requests without losing the existing precise subcommand surface.

**Current status:** `seam shell` / `seam chat` is the first slice. It provides a
REPL-style memory shell with slash commands for remember, search, context,
stats, doctor, and exit. Natural text defaults to prompt-ready context
retrieval.

**SOP:**
1. Keep existing `seam <subcommand>` behavior stable for scripts.
2. Make `seam shell` the interactive operator entrypoint.
3. Preserve slash commands as first-class controls: `/remember`, `/search`,
   `/context`, `/stats`, `/doctor`, `/exit`, then add `/model`, `/tools`,
   `/surface`, `/benchmark`, and `/web`.
4. Add model routing only after local memory/tool execution is stable. Provider
   keys must stay in local env/config, never in repo files.
5. Add command history, session transcript persistence, explicit tool-call
   confirmation, and project context loading from `AGENTS.md`/status/history.
6. Reuse the same runtime and REST/MCP surfaces; do not fork SEAM behavior into
   a separate CLI-only runtime.

**Gate:** A user can run `seam shell`, ask or paste natural text, persist useful
memory, retrieve context, inspect stats/health, and exit cleanly. The scripted
path `seam shell --once ...` must remain testable in CI.

### A1: NL→MIRL Compilation Animation

**What:** When a user runs `compile <text>` in the dashboard, show a live animation of the compilation process — text being parsed, records appearing one by one with their type labels (ENT, CLM, REL, ACT, OBJ) before the final summary.

**How:**
- Use Rich `Live` context manager in `dashboard.py`
- On compile, stream record creation events from `compile_nl` by yielding intermediate batches
- Each record appears with a typewriter-style pop: `[green]ENT[/green] ent:project:seam → "SEAM"`
- Final frame shows the full compiled batch summary

**SOP:**
1. Add a `compile_nl_streaming` variant or hook to `seam_runtime/nl.py` that yields records as they are produced
2. Wire the stream into `DashboardApp.execute` for the compile command
3. Render each yield step via `Rich.Live` with a short frame delay (50ms)
4. Write a `--snapshot` test that captures the final frame

**Gate:** Animation must not break `--snapshot` mode or scripted `run_script` execution.

---

### A2: Benchmark Progress Bar & Live Metrics

**What:** During `seam benchmark run all`, show a live progress bar with per-family status, current scores, and elapsed time — not just a final JSON dump.

**How:**
- Rich `Progress` with one task per benchmark family
- Live-update recall@k, token savings, and pass/fail as each case completes
- Final frame shows the summary table

**SOP:**
1. Add an optional `progress_callback` parameter to `run_benchmark_suite` in `benchmarks.py`
2. Wire it into the CLI and dashboard benchmark command
3. Dashboard: use `Rich.Live` wrapping a `Progress` + results table

**Gate:** Must not change the benchmark output bundle format or break `benchmark verify`.

---

### A3: Benchmark History Graphs (ASCII sparklines)

**What:** In the Benchmark tab, show a sparkline graph of recall@k and token savings across the last N stored runs, so you can see whether the system is improving or regressing over time.

**How:**
- Query `benchmark_runs` table from SQLite for last 10 runs
- Compute per-family summary metrics per run
- Render as ASCII sparklines using a lightweight library (`sparklines`, `plotext`, or hand-rolled)
- Show in the Benchmark tab's third panel column

**SOP:**
1. Add a `load_benchmark_history(limit)` helper to `storage.py`
2. Add `_build_benchmark_history_graph()` to `DashboardApp`
3. Swap it into the Benchmark tab layout alongside the existing summary table
4. Sparkline renders as a single Rich `Text` object — no external rendering dependency

**Gate:** Must work with zero runs (show empty state gracefully) and with 1+ runs.

---

### A4: Vector Space Visualization

**What:** A new `vectors` command in the dashboard (or a standalone `seam vectors` CLI command) that projects stored embeddings to 2D using UMAP or t-SNE and renders a scatter plot colored by record kind.

**Do we need a separate tool?** No — but it needs optional dependencies. The projection math (`umap-learn` or `scikit-learn` for t-SNE) is heavy. Keep it behind an optional extra (`seam-runtime[viz]`). The rendering can be ASCII (via `plotext`) in the terminal or HTML canvas via a web artifact.

**How:**
1. Add `viz` optional extra to `pyproject.toml`: `umap-learn>=0.5`, `plotext>=5.0`
2. Add `seam_runtime/viz.py`: load vectors from SQLite, run UMAP, return 2D coordinates + kind labels
3. Add `vectors` command to dashboard and CLI
4. Render: ASCII scatter via `plotext` for terminal; HTML canvas artifact for richer view

**SOP:**
1. Implement `viz.py` with graceful `ImportError` guard (same pattern as `rich` guard)
2. Add `vectors` command to `_build_command_parser` in `DashboardApp`
3. ASCII render first; HTML artifact as a follow-on
4. Test: mock the embedding data, assert 2D projection output shape

**Gate:** Must degrade gracefully if `umap-learn` is not installed — show a clear install hint.

---

### A5: Chat Tab with Claude Model

**What:** Add a `Chat` tab to the dashboard. The user types a message; SEAM retrieves relevant context from the DB; the context + message is sent to Claude API; the response appears in the result panel. The model can also invoke SEAM operations as tool calls.

**How:**
- New tab: `runtime | benchmark | chat`
- Chat history stored in `DashboardApp` as a deque
- On each message: run `search_ir` + `pack_ir` to get context, send as system prompt to Claude
- Claude can call tools: `compile`, `search`, `context`, `stats`
- Response streamed into the result panel via Rich `Live`

**Required:** `anthropic` SDK installed. Add `chat` optional extra to `pyproject.toml`.

**SOP:**
1. Add `chat` optional extra: `anthropic>=0.40`
2. Add `_build_chat_context(query)` to `DashboardApp` — retrieves and packs relevant records
3. Add `ChatSession` dataclass: messages list, tool definitions
4. Add `chat` command to parser; wire into `execute()`
5. Define SEAM tools for Claude: `seam_search`, `seam_compile`, `seam_context`, `seam_stats`
6. Render streamed response using Rich `Live`
7. Add `Chat` tab to header tab switcher

**Gate:** Must not require `anthropic` for any non-chat operation. Chat tab shows "anthropic not installed — run pip install seam-runtime[chat]" if missing.

---

### A6: Dashboard as a Benchmarking Presentation Tool

**What:** A `--present` mode for the dashboard that locks into full-screen benchmark display — large metrics, color-coded pass/fail cells, animated score bars — suitable for showing SEAM benchmark results in a demo or presentation context.

**How:**
- `seam dashboard --present` launches in presentation mode
- Full terminal width used for benchmark summary table with large text
- Scores animate from 0 to actual value on load (progress bar fill)
- Auto-refreshes every 30s from the latest persisted run

**SOP:**
1. Add `--present` flag to the dashboard CLI parser
2. Add `run_presentation()` method to `DashboardApp`
3. Build a `_build_presentation_layout()` that uses Rich `Table` with larger cells and styled score columns
4. Auto-refresh: use `Rich.Live` with `refresh_per_second=0.033` (30s equivalent via manual control)

---

## Track B — Command Terminology & README Refinement
History pointer: see `HISTORY#002`, `HISTORY#024`, `HISTORY#033`.

### B1: Command Naming Audit

**Current problems:**
- `compile-nl` / `compile-dsl` — "compile" is developer-speak for a memory tool
- `lossless-compress` / `compress-doc` — redundant aliases with inconsistent style
- `promote-symbols` — vague; users don't know what "promote" means here
- `rag-sync` / `rag-search` — internal jargon leaking into the surface
- `transpile` — very developer-specific
- `reconcile` — ambiguous to non-developers

**Proposed theme: "SEAM as a knowledge operating system"**

All commands should feel like natural operations on a memory system:

| Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `compile-nl` | `remember` or `learn` | User is teaching SEAM something |
| `compile-dsl` | `script` | DSL is structured input — scripting feels right |
| `persist` | `store` | Plain English |
| `search` | `find` | Intuitive |
| `retrieve` | `fetch` | Consistent with find |
| `lossless-compress` | `compress` | Single clean verb |
| `lossless-decompress` | `restore` | Paired with compress |
| `promote-symbols` | `mint` | Symbols are being created/promoted into the system |
| `reconcile` | `sync` | Aligns state |
| `transpile` | `convert` | Plain English |
| `context` | keep | Already good |
| `pack` | keep | Already good |
| `doctor` | keep | Already great |
| `dashboard` | keep | Already great |

**SOP:**
1. Add new names as primary commands; keep all existing names as compatibility aliases
2. Update `--help` text to use the new names first, aliases in parentheses
3. Update `installers/README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` to use new names
4. Do NOT remove aliases — external scripts and muscle memory should never break
5. Gate: all existing tests pass unchanged (aliases still work)

---

### B2: Argument Consistency Pass

**Current problems:**
- `--vector-backend` / `--semantic-backend` are the same flag with two names
- `--vector-path` / `--chroma-path` — leaks Chroma implementation detail
- `--pack-budget` vs `--budget` — inconsistent naming across commands
- `--min-savings` only appears in some benchmark commands

**Proposed fixes:**
- Consolidate to `--backend` (seam|chroma|pgvector) with `--semantic-backend` as alias
- Rename `--vector-path` → `--backend-path`
- Standardize `--budget` everywhere
- Document all flags in a single reference section in `installers/README.md`

---

### B3: README Consolidation

**Current state:** There are multiple README files (`installers/README.md`, `benchmarks/README.md`, `experimental/retrieval_orchestrator/README.md`) with overlapping and sometimes stale content.

**SOP:**
1. Audit all README files for stale content
2. Make `installers/README.md` the operator-facing entry point (install + quickstart)
3. Move benchmark operator docs to `benchmarks/README.md`
4. Move retrieval architecture docs to `experimental/retrieval_orchestrator/README.md`
5. Add a root-level `README.md` that links to all of the above

---

## Track C — Benchmark Hardening
History pointer: see `HISTORY#008`, `HISTORY#011`, and planned benchmark hardening items `HISTORY#036`-`HISTORY#040`.

### C1: Holdout Suites

**What:** Cases that were never used during development and are only run at publish time. Results from holdout suites are the only ones that count as external claims.

**Status:** Implemented 2026-04-27. See `HISTORY#092`.

**SOP:**
1. `benchmarks/fixtures/holdout/` exists and local JSON files are ignored by git
2. `seam benchmark run --holdout` only loads fixtures from that directory
3. `--holdout` requires an interactive confirmation or `--confirm-holdout`
4. Default holdout JSON bundles are stored separately under `benchmarks/runs/holdout/`

---

### C2: Benchmark Diff Tooling

**What:** `seam benchmark diff <run-a.json> <run-b.json>` — shows a structured delta between two runs: which cases improved, which regressed, by how much.

**Status:** Implemented 2026-04-27. See `HISTORY#092`.

**SOP:**
1. Use `seam benchmark diff <run-a> <run-b>` with bundle paths or persisted run ids
2. The diff verifies both bundles, joins exact matches on case hash, and falls back to `family::case_id` when the case hash changed
3. Numeric and boolean metrics get per-case deltas with green/red/gray indicators
4. JSON and pretty output include summary counts for improvements, regressions, added cases, and removed cases

---

### C3: Gold Standard Benchmarks

**What:** Run SEAM's retrieval engine against publicly known benchmarks to get externally comparable numbers.

**Target benchmarks:**
- **BEIR** (Benchmarking IR): 18 diverse retrieval tasks — covers fact retrieval, argument mining, biomedical, financial
- **MTEB** (Massive Text Embedding Benchmark): evaluates embedding quality across classification, clustering, retrieval
- **MS-MARCO**: passage ranking at scale

**SOP:**
1. Add `benchmarks/external/` directory for gold standard fixture adapters
2. Write a BEIR adapter that converts BEIR datasets into SEAM retrieval fixtures
3. Run SEAM's hybrid retrieval (SQLite + SBERT) against BEIR tasks
4. Store results in `benchmarks/runs/` with a `source=beir` tag
5. Document results in `benchmarks/BENCHMARK_LOG.md`

**Note:** This requires downloading BEIR datasets (~GB scale). Keep adapters separate from the main fixture suite.

---

### C4: Adversarial Testing

**What:** Deliberately try to break SEAM — malformed MIRL, adversarial queries, very long documents, Unicode edge cases, concurrent writes, empty databases.

**SOP:**
1. Add `benchmarks/fixtures/adversarial/` with edge-case inputs
2. Write an `adversarial` benchmark family in `benchmarks.py`
3. Each case should either pass cleanly or fail with a specific known error — no silent corruption
4. Target: 100% cases either pass or raise a documented exception

---

### C5: Cross-Machine Reproducibility

**What:** The same benchmark run on Windows and Linux should produce identical scores.

**SOP:**
1. Add a `reference_run.json` to the repo as a locked reference
2. `seam benchmark verify --reference reference_run.json` checks current scores against reference within a tolerance
3. CI-equivalent: run this check before any claim of benchmark improvement

---

## Track D — Model Skills & Automation
History pointer: see `HISTORY#041`-`HISTORY#043`.

### D1: SEAM as Claude Tool Set

**What:** Define SEAM operations as Claude tool_use functions so a Claude agent can use SEAM's memory as a live knowledge base during a conversation.

**Tools to define:**
- `seam_compile(text: str) → IRBatch` — compile and persist natural language
- `seam_search(query: str, budget: int) → SearchResult` — retrieve relevant records
- `seam_context(query: str) → Pack` — get a generation-ready context pack
- `seam_compress(text: str) → LosslessArtifact` — compress to machine text
- `seam_stats() → dict` — runtime health and record counts

**SOP:**
1. Create `seam_runtime/tools.py` — defines tool schemas as Anthropic tool_use dicts
2. Add `SeamToolExecutor` class that maps tool_name → runtime method call
3. Wire into the dashboard Chat tab (Track A5)
4. Document as a standalone integration guide

---

### D2: Auto-Compression Pipeline

**What:** A background process (or CLI command) that watches a directory, compresses new files with SEAM-LX/1, and persists the MIRL to the database automatically.

**SOP:**
1. Add `seam watch <directory>` command to CLI
2. Use `watchdog` library (new optional extra) to monitor file events
3. On new/modified file: compress → compile-nl → persist → index
4. Log each operation to a watch log in SQLite
5. Add `seam watch --once` for a single-pass scan without ongoing watch

---

### D3: Batch Compile

**What:** `seam batch-compile <glob>` — compile and persist multiple files at once with a progress bar and summary report.

**SOP:**
1. Add `batch-compile` command to CLI
2. Accept a glob pattern or directory
3. Process files in parallel using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`
4. Show Rich progress bar; write a summary JSON on completion
5. Gate: test with 1 file, 10 files, and an empty glob

---

## Track E — Architecture & Scalability
History pointer: see `HISTORY#012`, `HISTORY#019`, and planned scale tracks `HISTORY#044`-`HISTORY#046`.

### E1: PgVector as Configurable Default

**What:** When `SEAM_PGVECTOR_DSN` is set, PgVector is already used automatically. The next step is making it the explicit recommended backend for deployments with >10k records, and adding a migration path from SQLite vector index to PgVector.

**SOP:**
1. Add `seam migrate-vectors --to pgvector` command
2. Reads all vector embeddings from SQLite vector_index, writes them to PgVector
3. Verifies row counts match before and after
4. Marks the migration in a `migrations` table so it's idempotent

---

### E2: Multi-Tenant Namespacing

**What:** SEAM already has namespaces (`ns`) and scopes (`scope`) on records. The next step is enforcing tenant isolation at the API level — a `tenant_id` that gates all queries.

**SOP:**
1. Add `tenant_id` column to `ir_records` and related tables (migration)
2. Add `--tenant` flag to all CLI commands
3. All queries filter by tenant_id unless `--all-tenants` is passed (operator-only)
4. Test: two tenants with overlapping record IDs — queries must not cross-contaminate

---

### E3: REST API Surface

**What:** Expose SEAM operations as a lightweight HTTP API so external systems can compile, search, and retrieve without running a full Python process.

**Status:** Implemented 2026-04-27. See `HISTORY#094`.

**SOP:**
1. `seam serve` runs FastAPI/Uvicorn through the optional `server` extra.
2. Endpoints: `POST /compile`, `POST /compile-dsl`, `GET /search`, `POST /context`, `POST /lossless-compress`, `POST /persist`, `GET /stats`, `GET /health`.
3. Auth: Bearer token through `SEAM_API_TOKEN` for protected endpoints.
4. Rate limiting: `SEAM_API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` or `SEAM_API_RATE_LIMIT`; `/health` is unauthenticated but still rate-limited.
5. Tests: FastAPI `TestClient` coverage for auth, compile/search/context/stats, and rate limiting.

---

## Track F — Docs, Setup Guides, and Error Playbooks

### F1: Operator Setup Guide with Exact Commands

**What:** Publish a single setup guide with exact copy/paste commands for Windows, Linux, and WSL2, including optional extras and verification commands.

**SOP:**
1. Add `docs/setup.md` with exact command blocks for:
   - creating virtual env
   - installing base deps
   - installing extras (`[dash]`, `[pgvector]`, `[sbert]`, `[all-extras]`)
   - running smoke checks (`seam doctor`, `seam dashboard --snapshot`, benchmark smoke)
2. Add a short "known good first run" section with expected command output fragments.
3. Link `docs/setup.md` from root `README.md` and `installers/README.md`.
4. Gate: a clean machine can reach `seam doctor: PASS` by following only this doc.

---

### F2: Documented Error Catalog and Fix Procedures

**What:** Create a troubleshooting catalog that maps common operator errors to exact recovery steps.

**SOP:**
1. Add `docs/errors.md` with one section per documented error:
   - symptom text (exact error snippets)
   - root cause
   - fix commands
   - verification command after fix
2. Include current high-frequency paths:
   - missing optional dependency (Textual/PgVector/SBERT)
   - pgvector DSN configured but unreachable
   - Chroma path/index sync failures
   - benchmark bundle verification failures
3. Add "do not proceed" blockers and escalation steps.
4. Gate: each documented error has at least one reproducible verification command.

---

### F3: How-To Runbooks for Daily Operations

**What:** Add task-oriented runbooks for common operator workflows so users can execute standard flows without source code spelunking.

**SOP:**
1. Add `docs/howto/` with runbooks:
   - ingest and retrieve memory
   - run guarded real-adapter checks
   - archive benchmark bundles to Documents
   - recover from interrupted runs
2. Keep runbooks command-first with short explanation blocks.
3. Add a top-level index file `docs/howto/README.md`.
4. Gate: every runbook has prerequisites, exact commands, and a success checklist.

## Track G — Functional Visual Memory System

History pointer: see `HISTORY#112` and `HISTORY#113` for the first HS/1
surface flow.

### G1: Document-to-Machine-Language Compiler

**What:** Convert documents into directly readable MIRL or `SEAM-RC/1` records
that preserve facts, quote spans, headings, table cells, references, and source
provenance.

**Status:** Implemented in HISTORY#145 for the first wave of structural
primitives. `seam_runtime/lossless.py:_structural_quote_spans` is the single
extractor; both the readable compiler and the benchmark gate verifier delegate
to it so the compiled records and the verifier records cannot drift out of
sync. Records currently emitted:

- quoted strings (`"..."`) → `text` is the raw quote span
- markdown headings (`# ... ######`) → `text` is `heading:<title>`
- markdown 2-column table data rows → `text` is `cell:<col1>=<col2>`
- inline bracket citations (e.g. `[Smith2024]`) → `text` is `citation:[Key]`
- reference list phrases (split on `. `) → `text` is `ref:<phrase>`

The release-blocking `surface` benchmark family at
`benchmarks/fixtures/surface_cases.json` covers all five via richer document
cases for heading recall, table cell lookup, and citation/reference extraction.
`seam benchmark gate` enforces `direct_query_exactness_rate == 1.0` on those
cases. Adding a new structural primitive means appending to
`_structural_quote_spans` plus a fixture case exercising it. Future primitives
to consider: lists, code blocks, dates, key-value blocks, links.

**Gate:** SEAM can answer detail questions from the emitted machine language
without opening the original document.

### G2: Stored Surface Library

**What:** Add a managed library for `.seam.png` surfaces. The PNG stores the
payload bytes; SQLite stores only metadata, hashes, status, and lookup fields.

**Status:** Implemented and merged to `main` on 2026-05-06.

**Gate:** A stored surface can be listed, verified, queried, searched, used for
context, imported, and audited by hash.

### G3: Direct Image-Surface Query

**What:** Make the stored image artifact itself a readable memory source.
Queries decode PNG pixels into MIRL/RC bytes in memory, verify hashes, then run
the normal parser/search/context path.

**Status:** Implemented for MIRL and RC/1 payloads. Continue expanding the
document-structure records that RC/1 exposes to the query path.

**Gate:** Query/search/context works from a stored surface path or surface id
without OCR, source-document restoration, or prior SQLite import.

### G4: Surface Store Benchmarks

**What:** Add benchmark cases for the full functional loop:
document -> machine language -> surface -> stored surface -> direct answer.

**Status:** Implemented and merged to `main` on 2026-05-06.

**Gate:** `surface_exact_rate`, `payload_hash_match_rate`, stored-surface lookup
rate, stored-surface query rate after original-output deletion, repair success
rate, repaired-copy query rate, and direct query exactness all stay at 100% for
release-blocking fixtures.

## Recommended Course — Priority Order

Use this section for current priority. Older planned entries `HISTORY#028`-
`HISTORY#047` are append-only planning cards; implemented items are superseded
by later done entries and status notes.

Current sequence:

```
Done - functional visual memory + foundational polish
- G1: Document-to-machine-language compiler (implemented; see HISTORY#145)
- G2: Stored surface library (implemented; merged 2026-05-06)
- G3: Direct image-surface query (implemented for MIRL and RC/1 payloads)

- C1: Holdout suites (implemented; supersedes HISTORY#036)
- C2: Benchmark diff tooling (implemented; supersedes HISTORY#037)
- E3: REST API surface (implemented; supersedes HISTORY#046)

Now - browser dashboard / REST API GUI
- A-Web: wire experimental/webui to real REST endpoints
- A-Web: split the single-file prototype into maintainable app shell modules
- A-Web: add browser smoke tests for real health/stats/search/context data
- A-CLI: keep seam shell aligned with MCP and REST surfaces

Next - dashboard and agent ergonomics
- A2: Benchmark progress bar
- A3: ASCII sparkline graphs
- A1: NL->MIRL compilation animation
- A6: Presentation mode
- D1: SEAM as Claude/Gemini/Codex tool set
- A5: Chat tab in dashboard

Later - benchmark credibility and scale
- C5: Cross-machine reproducibility
- C4: Adversarial testing
- C3: Gold standard benchmarks (BEIR/MTEB)
- D2: Auto-compression pipeline
- D3: Batch compile
- A4: Vector visualization
- E1: PgVector migration helper
- E2: Multi-tenant namespacing
```

Snapshot archival policy: do not delete or compress `.seam/snapshots/` ad hoc.
Keep the latest verified continuity snapshot available. If snapshot count or
size becomes a problem, add an explicit local-only retention tool that archives
older verified snapshots outside normal git-tracked source and records the
policy in `REPO_LEDGER.md`.

## SOP: Approach Rules for Every Track

These rules apply to every piece of work on this repo, regardless of track.

1. **Tests before merge.** Every new feature needs at least one test before it lands. No exceptions.

2. **No benchmark claims without bundle verification.** Any improvement to retrieval or compression must be backed by a verified JSON bundle in `benchmarks/runs/`.

3. **SQLite stays canonical.** PgVector, Chroma, and any future vector store are derived retrieval layers. The source of truth is always SQLite.

4. **Aliases before removals.** When renaming a command, add the new name and keep the old as an alias. Only remove old names after a deprecation cycle with a warning.

5. **Optional extras for heavy dependencies.** ML libraries, Postgres drivers, watch daemons — all go behind optional extras. The base install must stay lean.

6. **Update the ledger.** Every session that changes direction or completes a milestone must update `REPO_LEDGER.md` and `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

7. **Handoff block.** Every session that ends mid-work must leave a handoff block in `REPO_LEDGER.md` so the next Claude session can resume without re-reading the full conversation.

8. **Lossless is sacred.** The lossless roundtrip must always pass SHA-256 verification. Any change to compression/decompression must re-run `seam demo lossless` and verify the output.

9. **Doctor must pass.** After any install-path change, `seam doctor` must return PASS. If it doesn't, that's a blocker.

10. **Benchmark diff before claiming improvement.** Use `seam benchmark diff` before publishing any improvement claim. Numbers alone are not enough — show the delta.
